       "1. **Move Block A (with Block C on top):** Carefully slide block A, along with block C which is on top of it, off the table and place them both to the side. This ensures that block C remains on top of block A without directly touching it.\n",

       "2. **Move Block B:** Now that block B is accessible and not obstructed, pick it up and place it in the desired location where you want to build the tower.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Separate Block C from Block A:** Carefully tilt block A to one side, allowing block C to slide off onto the table. This step removes block C from the top of block A without directly touching block C.\n",
